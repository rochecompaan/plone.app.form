UberSelectionWidget to-do:

Dynamic/KSS mode:

  - Trigger search when clicking on the Search button, not just the Enter key

  - Need a client-side action to select items
    
        - For multi-USW, this should add a new checkbox in the select area,
          with the right name (so that it re-appears if the form is reloaded,
          e.g. after validation)
        
        - For multi-USW, also need a handler to make the box disappear when
          unticked
          
        - For single-USW, should use radio button and ensure that only one
          box is shown
          
  - Visual indicators that parent/browse is available (e.g. arrows - should
    also be clickable)
    
  - Widget rendering needs some CSS love
  
  - Currently we limit to 20 search results - need to have an explicit
    batching. This can use internal scrolling with lazy loading.
    
Static/non-KSS mode:

  - Also needs working initial query
  
  - Also needs batching
